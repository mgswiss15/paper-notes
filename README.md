# paper-notes

Informal notes about some papers I've read for my future self who is likely to forget. 
I explain the papers the way I understand them, using terminology and logic natural to me.
This means I may deviate from the original paper structure, notation, etc.
At places, my interpretation may be incorrect due to lack of understanding.
I will strive for this not to happen too often but Iâ€™m certainly not infallible.
This is a working document, not polished, with possible typos, editing errors, etc.

The notes are organised by topic. Each folder has the full tex version as well as a pdf for direct viewing. 

**While this is a public repository, users are adviced to judge for themselves to what extent they want to trust the info I give.**

My notes, even less formal than those here, on somewhat more random choice of papers can be found in my Dropbox paper [here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Paper-notes--A2fu4jpSEcFqS4ZD9ClQTiUKAQ-ZrybCQndYWVR08wpTi1TW).
