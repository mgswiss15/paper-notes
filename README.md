# paper-notes

Informal notes about some papers I've read for my future self who is likely to forget. 
I explain the papers the way I understand them, using terminology and logic natural to me.
This means I may deviate from the original paper structure, notation, etc.
At places, my interpretation may be incorrect due to lack of understanding.
I will strive for this not to happen too often but Iâ€™m certainly not infallible.
This is a working document, not polished, with possible typos, editing errors, etc.

While this is a public repository, users are adviced to judge for themselves to what extent they want to trust the info I give.
